- **Offline-first operation**: Tool now works offline by default, no API calls unless explicitly requested
- **`--online` flag**: New CLI option to enable external API sources (ClearlyDefined, PyPI, npm)
- **Bundled SPDX license data**: Package includes 700+ SPDX license definitions with full text for 40+ common licenses
- **License text in notices**: Human-readable notices now include full license text
- **Debug logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting copyright extraction
- **Copyright validation**: Improved filtering of invalid copyright patterns (URLs, code snippets, etc.)
- **Build automation**: Scripts to update SPDX license data during package build

### Changed
- **Default behavior**: Changed from online-first to offline-first operation
- **API usage**: External APIs now supplement rather than replace local analysis
- **Copyright extraction**: Significantly improved accuracy with better pattern matching and deduplication
- **Logging**: Reduced verbosity in normal mode, cleaner output

### Fixed
- **Copyright false positives**: Fixed extraction of code patterns as copyright holders
- **Duplicate copyrights**: Improved deduplication of copyright holders with variations
- **Invalid domains**: Fixed "domain.invalid" and URL patterns appearing in copyright
- **SSL warnings**: Suppressed urllib3 SSL warnings on macOS systems
- **Package build**: Fixed missing submodules in wheel distribution

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance**: Faster processing without network calls in default mode
- **Reliability**: Works without internet connection
- **Privacy**: No data sent to external services by default
- **Size**: Package includes all necessary data (1.5MB of SPDX licenses)
