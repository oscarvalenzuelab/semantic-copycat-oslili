The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.6] - 2025-09-06

### Added
- **Tier 0 Exact Hash Matching**: Added SHA-256 and MD5 hash matching as the first detection tier
  - Pre-computed hashes for all 699 SPDX licenses
  - Support for license variants and aliases
  - 100% confidence for exact matches
  - New `DetectionMethod.HASH` enum value
- **Hash Inventory System**: Comprehensive hash inventory for license matching
  - Standard SPDX license hashes
  - Common variants (e.g., gradle-wrapper Apache-2.0)
  - Hash lookup tables for fast matching
  - Support for hash collisions (e.g., GPL versions)

### Improved
- **Detection Tier Reorganization**: Four-tier system: Hash → Dice-Sørensen → TLSH → Regex
